DDL Script: Create Gold Views
===============================================================================
**Script Purpose:**  
This script is designed to create views for the Gold layer in the data warehouse. 
The Gold layer features the final dimension and fact tables, organized in a Star Schema format. 

Each view in this script performs transformations and integrates data from the Silver layer to produce a clean, enriched 
and business-ready dataset.

Usage:
    - These views can be directly queried for analytics and reporting purposes.
